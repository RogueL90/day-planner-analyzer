### Write your day (daily note format)

Plan your day as normal checklist lines with a start time, an end time, and a task name. Use the Day Planner plugin or write directly in a note named `2026-02-23.md`.

Example:

```markdown
# Day planner

- [ ] 9:00am - 9:30am Morning routine
- [x] 10:00am - 11:00am* Deep work // focus block
```

**General rules**

- One task per line, with times on the left: `9:00am - 10:00am Task name`
- Check the box `[x]` when you finish a task
- Add a `*` after the **end** time for a priority task: `11:00am* Important meeting`
- Add `//` after the name for a note that should not count as part of the task name

#### Pick a time range

Use the tabs at the top: **Past 7 days**, **Past 30 days**, or **Custom**.

#### Productivity assistant

Ask things like what to focus on today, how to reduce gaps in your schedule, or how to finish more priority tasks. The assistant only uses the summary for the range you have open — not your full note text.

You can expand the chat, clear the conversation, or change the model in settings. Chat history is saved until you clear it.

#### Daily breakdown

A day-by-day table: when your day started and ended, priority tasks done, and how many tasks you planned vs completed.

## Good to know

- Only notes named `YYYY-MM-DD.md` are included
- Lines that don’t follow the time-range format are skipped
- This plugin analyzes and displays stats only — it does not edit your schedule
- The assistant needs internet access and only sees summary numbers, not your full notes
- If two tasks overlap in time, unplanned time is calculated as if they were one block

I don't take donations, this plugin being useful to someone is enough :)
